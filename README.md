Responsive Web Page Project

This initial project serves to test my initial skills is utilizing a designer layout to build a responsive web page utilizing HTML & CSS.

I hope to replicate the layout as closely as possible to that in the design file. Please reference black-light-aquarium.xd for the original layout.
